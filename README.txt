EDGE for ORIC
=============

(c)2017 Drpsy & TotoShampoin

Current status
--------------

Drpsy : programs, assembler and C
Totoshampoin : Game design, graphism, fonts, animations

Installation
------------

Store the 2 .tap files in the tapes folder of Oricutron.

Execution
---------

Launch Oricutron and use either EdgePackA.tap or EdgePackB.tap
Each pack contains 16 levels, pack B is much more difficult to achieve.
Once you have finished all the 16 levels or if you leave before the end, you will see your score.

Commands
--------

Use the keyboard arrows to move the cube towards the target.
You can also use the RFHU or HUIL keys for a more isometric and intuitive experience.

G toggles the GPS. But do not use it too often. It costs points!

At level startup, you can press any key not already affected to let the cube fall or use the move keys to make the cube fall wth a first move. Sometimes, it may help you not to fall into water :-)

Use the S key to suicide when no more possible move. You will be able to restart the level or end the game and get your score.

Be patient ! Perhaps you shall have a paper and a pencil not too far to remember some paths !
